# Lab - Class 26
## Project: intro to django

Author: Sarah Glass for Python 401

## Overview

Create web site in Django with 2 pages

- home page
- about page
- create views/urls/templates as needed for home and about pages
- use ancestor template to contain navigation elements
- Should be built the “Django way” aka match the structure of in-class demo

Configure your project to use TailwindCSS/Flowbite

- Just basic styling is sufficient for today, but stretch out if you’ve got time!
